# Food Menu Webpage

## Project Overview
Your main goal is to create a Food Menu Webpage! üçîüçï The task involves building a landing page with the following sections:
- Filters section
- Food items section
- Header with the Logo and Search Bar
- Footer to balance the bottom of the web page

To make it even more interesting, we're using the Food API available at [TheMealDB](https://www.themealdb.com/api.php). Additionally, we aim to mimic the design, colors, and theme of [Swiggy](https://www.swiggy.com/) for a cohesive look. The application must be fully responsive and compatible across various screen sizes.

## Key Components

### Header Section
- Includes a logo and a search bar (Note: the search bar design needs to be achieved, but it does not need to be functional).

### Filters Section
- Styled based on the provided reference image.
- Upon clicking the ‚ÄúFilter‚Äù tag, a dropdown should appear.
- Only implement ‚ÄúFilter By Area‚Äù (See API docs for relevant endpoints). The dropdown should list Areas along with HTML Radio boxes. Users can select any Area, and clicking ‚ÄúApply‚Äù will dynamically update the Food Items Section with matching food items from that Area.
- Implement Sorting Functionality to allow users to Sort Food Items Alphabetically.

### Food Items Section (Data Grid)
- By default, display all Indian food items (refer to the API docs). Note: we focus on showcasing food items within the scope of this assignment.
- Each food item card should include an image, name, and ratings (ratings can be generated randomly). Clicking on a food item opens a Modal with additional details about the selected item (see API docs for relevant endpoints).
- Clicking on a food item triggers a Modal that provides additional details about the selected food item. Ensure the Modal design is consistent with the overall aesthetics.
- Incorporate Pagination, maintaining consistency with the overall colors and theme.

### Footer Section
- A footer to balance the bottom of the web page.
